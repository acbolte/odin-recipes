        <h5>Yes, this is a horse, and yes, we are going to eat it.</h5>
        <p>This dish calls for horse meat. Chances are, you don't normally do that. If you don't want to, or you can't get horse meat, you can use beef instead.</p>
        <p>If you're not sure what part of the animal to use, go for a cheaper cut, with some fat on it, they're often the best for this kind of application.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 kg of good stew horse-meat or beef</li>
            <li>1 liter of dry red wine</li>
            <li>a handfull of black peppercorns</li>
            <li>salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the meat into roughly 3 cm chunks and brown it in a large pot. You don't have to brown all of it, half is fine.</li>
            <li>Get the red wine in there! Scrub the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to get all that good stuff into the dish.</li>
            <li>Add the crushed peppercorns.</li>
            <li>Let it simmer for about four hours.</li>
            <li>Season with salt.</li>
        </ol>
