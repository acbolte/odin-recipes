        <h5>It's the perfect proof that you only need three ingredients to be happy</h5>
        <p>Ok, maybe its four ingredients, but who really counts salt anyway? Ths italien meat dish will make you very happy if you're into that sort of thing.</p>
        <p>Note: Several traditional recipes call for horse meat. If you don't happen to have a horse-butcher near you (I'm from northern Germany, where you still get them sometimes) just use beef. If you're not sure what part of the animal to use, go for a cheaper cut, they're often the best for this kind of application</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 kg of good stew horse-meat or beef</li>
            <li>1 liter of dry red wine</li>
            <li>a handfull of black peppercorns</li>
            <li>salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the meat into roughly 3 cm chunks and brown it in a large pot. You don't have to brown all of it, half is fine.</li>
            <li>Get the red wine in there! Scrub the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to get all that good stuff into the dish.</li>
            <li>Add the crushed peppercorns.</li>
            <li>Let it simmer for about four hours.</li>
            <li>Season with salt.</li>
        </ol>
