        <h5>It's the perfect proof that you only need two ingredients to be happy</h5>
        <p>Ok, maybe its three ingredients, but who really counts salt anyway? This chicken soup will make you very happy if you're into that sort of thing.</p>
        <p>Note: Technically, we're making Chicken stock, which you can make into soup by adding salt, which we will do, so there you go.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A chicken. Get the best one you can afford, it will be worth it.</li>
